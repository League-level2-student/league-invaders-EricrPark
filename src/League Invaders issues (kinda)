  
First step--
   On first step of first page it says "Create a new class called LeagueInvaders", however, the class is already created when you accept module 
   -- should say something along the lines of "Look in the project there should be class called league invaders" to get same effect of making them 
   aware of it
  
Second step--
   chill
   
Third step--
   Seems to give you a LOT of code to copy paste but idk -- literally only had to write public void a bunch of times 
   
Fourth step--
   You give a long explanation of how to code something -- then just give them the code to do it -- feels like you could make them actually think 
   more if you have them translate the words into code
